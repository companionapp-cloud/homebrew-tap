# Homebrew cask for the Companion desktop app (macOS).
#
# This file is the SOURCE for companionapp-cloud/homebrew-tap: the Release workflow
# (.github/workflows/release.yml, `homebrew-tap` job) stamps `version` and `sha256`
# from the freshly built release asset, then pushes the whole ../homebrew folder to
# the tap repo. Edit it here, never in the tap repo directly.
#
# The bundle is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Homebrew always quarantines cask
# downloads (the --no-quarantine flag was removed in Homebrew 4.7), and Gatekeeper
# refuses to open a quarantined unsigned app, so the postflight_steps below strip the
# attribute after install. Plain install, no flags:
#
#   brew install --cask companionapp-cloud/tap/companion

  # The app updates itself (apps/desktop/updates.go in the main repo), but this stays false
  # for now: `auto_updates true` would make a plain `brew upgrade` skip the cask, stranding
  # installs from before the updater existed (0.6.1 and earlier), which can only get it
  # through Homebrew. The cost of false is small: after the app updates itself, the next
  # `brew upgrade` reinstalls that same version, because Homebrew's record lags. Flip it
  # once those old installs have moved on.
